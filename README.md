The evaluation metrics indicate that the model is performing exceptionally well:

Accuracy: 0.9998 suggests that the model is correctly predicting the class labels with a high degree of accuracy.
Precision: 1.0 indicates that the model is achieving a perfect precision, meaning that all the positive predictions made by the model are indeed correct.
Recall: 0.9991 suggests that the model is able to identify the majority of the positive instances in the dataset.
F1 Score: 0.9995 represents a balanced measure of precision and recall, indicating a very high overall performance of the model.
ROC AUC Score: 0.9995 indicates that the model has an excellent ability to distinguish between the positive and negative classes.
Confusion Matrix: The confusion matrix shows that the model has made only one false negative prediction and no false positive predictions, with a large number of true positives and true negatives.
Overall, these evaluation metrics suggest that the model is highly accurate and effective in predicting the target variable.
